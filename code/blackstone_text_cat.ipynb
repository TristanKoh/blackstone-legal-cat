    "# Legal Text Classification with Blackstone\n",

    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the uses of Blackstone on Singaporean case law. By doing so, I hope to encourage others to get their hands dirty with basic programming and data science, especially law students that are interested in legal technology. Even for students whose interest lies in the law of technology rather than technology of law, I personally believe that one cannot simply discuss \"technology\" in the abstract when formulating legal rules that govern such technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, I empathise with those who may be apprehensive of programming / coding, as I was one and a half years ago. Hence, through this notebook, I aim to explain each step in the code as simply as possible, to demonstrate that one does not need to be particularly talented to self-learn programming.\n",

    "## About Blackstone\n",
    "\n",
    "Blackstone is a Python package that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect linguistic features in case law and classify the text into 5 categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The five categories are:\n",
    "\n",
    "AXIOM - The text appears to postulate a well-established principle\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCLUSION - The text appears to make a finding, holding, determination or conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "ISSUE - The text appears to discuss an issue or question\n",
    "\n",
    "LEGAL_TEST - The test appears to discuss a legal test\n",
    "\n",
    "UNCAT - The text does not fall into one of the four categories above"

    "## How Blackstone fits into the broader data science context\n",
    "\n",
    "As computers cannot understand text as humans do, NLP packages like Blackstone provide a set of utilities that allows us to create a mathematical model of the text, such that computers are able to process natural language. We call these models \"text representations\". The simplest of text representations (not used in Blackstone) is the Bag-of-Words representation. It represents the text as a count of words in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may imagine, such a representation loses significant semantic meaning, as it ignores word order and relative frequency of words in the text. This means that commonly used but less meaningful words like \"can\" and \"one\" have higher weightage in the model than more meaningful words like \"technology\" and \"programming\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, there are other, more complicated text representations that retain more semantic meaning in the text, such as as a Tf-IDF representation (which is essentially a weighted count of words) and word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blackstone uses the latter model. For brevity, this article (https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/) better explains how word embeddings work much better than I can, so I shall not go further into the details here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the usage and performance of Blackstone, I used the seminal Singaporean tort case of Spandeck v DSTA Agency (2007) 4 SLR(R) 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this jupyter notebook documents the text cleaning process and the prediction of the above legal categories."

For example, this sentence: \"The focus was on the closeness of the relationship between the parties, including physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, supported by the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is likely because such keywords like \"physical, circumstantial and causal proximity\", \"voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance\" directly relate to the test for duty of care in negligence. Hence while \"test\" itself does not appear in this sentence, these associated words that relate to the test for duty of care also increase the likelihood that the sentence refers to a legal test.\n",

    "Lastly, blackstone also categorises cases like \"Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman\" as a legal test, probably also due to the fact that the ratio for these cases relate to the test for duty of care in the UK (and blackstone was trained on UK legal data)."

For example, \"no escape from the truth\" (referring to a broad generalisation), \"in the tort of negligence\" (this phrase refers broadly to some concept in the tort of negligence). Generally, the method in which blackstone takes into account \"tone\" is just noting that such a sequence of words are more likely to occur in a sentence that relates to an axiom about the law. However, such a probabilistic model is still relatively successful in this regard."

[\n----------------------------------------\nIndeed, the various tests which have been applied by the courts following Donoghue v Stevenson are but a manifestation of one or more of the legal control mechanisms formulated by the courts within the general principles.\n----------------------------------------\n31     Although there were some cases prior to 1932 which purported to articulate some kind of general principle to determine the existence of a duty of care (see, for example, Heaven v Pender (1883) 11 QBD 503 at 509, per Brett MR), the search for a universal basis for duty is generally regarded to have begun with the House of Lords decision of Donoghue v Stevenson.\n----------------------------------------\nIn Spartan Steel & Alloys Ltd v Martin & Co (Contractors) Ltd [1973] QB 27, Lord Denning MR said (at 36):\n----------------------------------------\n37     Following this, Lord Brandon of Oakbrook remarked in Leigh and Sillavan Ltd v Aliakmon Shipping Co Ltd [1986] AC 785 at 815 that the propositions laid down by Lord Wilberforce in Anns “[do] not provide, and cannot … have been intended by Lord Wilberforce to provide, a universally applicable test of the existence and scope of a duty of care in the law of negligence”.\n----------------------------------------\nIn my opinion it is clear that Anns did not proceed upon any basis of established principle, but introduced a new species of liability governed by a principle indeterminate in character but having the potentiality of covering a wide range of situations, involving chattels as well as real property, in which it had never hitherto been thought that the law of negligence had any proper place.\n----------------------------------------\nIn relation to the scope of the duty owed by a local authority it proceeded upon what must, with due respect to its source, be regarded as a somewhat superficial examination of principle and there has been extreme difficulty, highlighted most recently by the speeches in [D & F Estates Ltd v Church Commissioners for England [1989] AC 177], in ascertaining upon exactly what basis of principle it did proceed.\n----------------------------------------\nWhilst recognising, of course, the importance of the underlying general principles common to the whole field of negligence, I think the law has now moved in the direction of attaching greater significance to the more traditional categorisation of distinct and recognisable situations as guides to the existence, the scope and the limits of the varied duties of care which the law imposes.\n----------------------------------------\nProf Stanton is of the view (at p 39) that, at a general level, “incrementalism may be regarded as restoring a traditional method of adjudication to the tort of negligence” in that it remains intertwined with a formula-based approach, and that the general principle should henceforth be applied in a more cautious manner.\n----------------------------------------\n43     If incrementalism is intended to return the development of liability in negligence to the basis that discrete sets of rules should govern different factual scenarios, the central problem, as Prof Stanton noted at p 48, is that it requires a return to an approach which has been systematically destroyed since Donoghue v Stevenson, as generations of lawyers have since been trained to believe that the tort of negligence is based on a common general principle.\n----------------------------------------\n"

    "\n",
    "\"A fair reading of the sentence (see [33] above) beginning with “in order to establish … it is not necessary to bring the facts within those of previous situations” does not preclude an incremental approach as the expression “the facts” does necessarily connote all the facts, and is capable of implying that it is only necessary to bring only some of the facts.\"\n",

    "\"There can be no doubt that to depart from the decision would re-establish a degree of certainty in this field of law which it has done a remarkable amount to upset.\"\n",

    "These sentences are summaries of prior precedent cases that are relevant to the decision of the case at hand.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Notwithstanding these judicial views, we agree with Phang, Saw & Chan ([26] supra at 42) that these observations are “puzzling, to say the least”.\"\n",

    "Overall, blackstone seemed to have done a relatively good job at detecting sentences that are \"summarial\" in nature, without relying on specific key words such as \"in conclusion\" etc. It also did not classify sentences that are merely factual recounts of cases, and instead only classified the CA's summary of the case after the CA had decribed the relevant facts."

      "A fair reading of the sentence (see [33] above) beginning with “in order to establish … it is not necessary to bring the facts within those of previous situations” does not preclude an incremental approach as the expression “the facts” does necessarily connote all the facts, and is capable of implying that it is only necessary to bring only some of the facts.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Similarly, the Australian High Court gave reasons in Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (1985) 60 ALR 1 (“Sutherland”) for declining to follow the direction in which Anns appeared to be taking the law in England.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "38     The two-stage test in Anns was finally overruled by the House of Lords in Murphy v Brentwood District Council [1991] 1 AC 398 (“Murphy”).\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "The result has been to keep the effect of the decision within reasonable bounds, but that has been achieved only by applying strictly the words of Lord Wilberforce and by refusing to accept the logical implications of the decision itself.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "There can be no doubt that to depart from the decision would re-establish a degree of certainty in this field of law which it has done a remarkable amount to upset.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "In Smith v Eric S Bush [1990] 1 AC 831, Lord Griffiths, in dealing with the question of when the law deems a person who has given advice to have assumed responsibility to the recipient who has acted on it and suffered damage, replied (at 865):\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Lord Oliver of Aylmerton said (at 487) that if the infliction of loss by the defendant on the claimant was to be categorised as wrongful, it was necessary to find some factor beyond the mere occurrence of the loss and the fact that its occurrence could be foreseen.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "The reason for this appears to be a fear of indeterminate liability owing to the fluid nature of pure economic losses which are not strictly restricted by the physical interaction of the parties involved (see further [66] below).\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Lord Oliver of Aylmerton lamented in Caparo ([23] supra at 633) thus:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "49     On appeal in Customs and Excise Commissioners ([43] supra), the House of Lords did not express a definitive view on whether or not the three “tests” mentioned by Longmore LJ were substantive tests in their own right and were all to be applied in any given case.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "It is abundantly clear that in Ocean Front this court did not follow the broad proposition laid down by Lord Wilberforce in Anns.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "57     That the “two-stage process” was only applicable to cases of pure economic loss was confirmed in The Sunrise Crane [2004] 4 SLR(R) 715.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "However, the dissenting judge in The Sunrise Crane took the view that a uniform approach should be applied to all cases of negligence, with the salient features of each case being determinative of the existence and scope of duty.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "58     The result of the majority’s pronouncement in The Sunrise Crane, as Dr Kumaralingam Amirthalingam notes in “The Sunrise Crane – Shedding New Light or Casting Old Shadows on Duty of Care?” [\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "In the case of Leigh and Sillivan Ltd v Aliakmon Shipping Co Ltd [1985] QB 350, Oliver LJ (as he then was) recognised this point when he said (at 375):\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Similarly, he, as Lord Oliver in Murphy ([38] supra), reiterated this point (at 485):\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "However, the absence of a factual precedent, which implies the presence of a novel situation, should not preclude the court from extending liability where it is just and fair to do so, taking into account the relevant policy consideration against indeterminate liability against a tortfeasor.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "As Lord Wilberforce himself observed in McLoughlin v. O’Brian [1983] 1 A.C. 410, 420, it is clear that foreseeability does not of itself, and automatically, lead to a duty of care.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "The truth is that the trilogy of cases referred to by Lord Wilberforce in Anns v. Merton London Borough Council [1978] A.C. 728, 751, each demonstrate particular sets of circumstances, differing in character, which were adjudged to have the effect of bringing into being a relationship apt to give rise to a duty of care.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "80     Notwithstanding these judicial views, we agree with Phang, Saw & Chan ([26] supra at 42) that these observations are “puzzling, to say the least”.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "In this respect, we agree with Nicholas J Mullany when he notes in “Proximity, Policy and Procrastination” (1992) 9 Aust Bar Rev 80 at 83 that:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "93     Finally, the appellant pointed out that cl 32.8 of the Contract made it clear that the appellant had no remedy vis-à-vis the Employer for “any damages, whether by way of interest or otherwise, for any failure or delay by the [SO] in certifying any payment due or payable to the Contractor”.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Since cl 32.8 had severely limited any recourse by the appellant to the Employer for damages arising from any failure or delay by the respondent in certifying any payment due or payable to the contractor, it was argued that the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Pacific Associates Inc v Baxter [1990] 1 QB 993 (“Pacific Associates”), which denied a duty of care in similar circumstances, was distinguishable as in that case there was no such restriction of the contractor’s right of recourse to the employer.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "As such, the court could not accept that the engineer had held himself out as accepting a duty of care outside the contractual framework, or that the contractor had relied on such an assumption of responsibility.\n",

      "114    On the facts of the present case, the same reasons above articulated by Russell LJ in Pacific Associates can also be characterised as policy considerations under the second stage of the test in Anns.\n",

    "## 6. Concluding remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the data cleaning process:\n",
    "\n",
    "We walked through the steps needed to prepare the data such that blackstone can be used: From importing the raw text file of the Spandeck case, to removing the formatting (like the new tab and new line formatting) from the text, to parsing the cleaned text into spacy to convert the raw text into a spacy document, and finally predicting using blackstone on individual sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the \"exciting\" part of data analysis (ie getting classification and predictions) is also the easiest part of the process. The majority of the work is spent on data cleaning and preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About blackstone's performance on the Spandeck case:\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that overall, blackstone has performed relatively well in its classification. Inspecting the classifications manually did not reveal many predictions by blackstone that did not seem to make sense, given the category. Most classifications could be plausibly explained to belong to a particular category because of certain phrases that indicated a \"conclusion\" or \"axiom\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the classification of conclusions and axioms seem to overlap: A conclusion (or summary) of a often cited precedent (such as Donoghue v Stevenson) could be construed to be an axiom about the test for duty of care as well. (ie. In that the test is always something about the reasonable foreseeability of harm). Therefore, if one were to use blackstone to conduct data analytics of case precedent and principles, it would be good to look at those sentences classified as \"conclusion\" and and those classified as \"axioms\", as it casts a wider \"net\" on classifying legal principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible future uses of Blackstone in Singapore's local context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Blackstone's performance on local case law seems to be promising, especially since it was trained on UK case law. Perhaps blackstone can be further trained on local case law in the future. This would require labelled local case law (ie. each sentence in the case assigned a category by a human) across a wide spectrum of legal issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "With more robust training of blackstone to adapt it to local case law, one direct application of it is the partial automation of case headnotes which are currently manually done by Justices Law Clerks. At the very least, blackstone can assist JLCs in writing these headnotes by first providing a preliminary classification of the case, which could point the JLCs to the relevant parts to further refine the summary.
